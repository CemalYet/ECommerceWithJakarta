# ECommerceWithJakarta
The main aim was to develop a web application as loosely coupled as possible. For that reason, java entity, session, and message beans were used for business logic. Regarding the client-side, JSF, servlets, and prime faces were being used. Additionally, SOAP and Restful web services were also created.
